## The dataset 
National renewal is what both the rival French presidential candidates are promising, but they offer very different paths to get there.

Liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron - winner of the first round - and nationalist Marine Le Pen are already revolutionising French politics. Mr Macron leads a new movement called En Marche (On the Move), while Ms Le Pen is backed by the National Front (FN). They disagree on many issues, especially Europe and immigration.

The decisive second round was decisive and polls showed Mr Macron with a firm lead. But what are the main patterns of the towns that support Macron and Le Pen visions?

The data set was retrieved from https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/les-donnees-des-elections/ which is the open public data platform "data.gouv.fr" that hosts the data sets and records their reuses.

The data set is cleaned in Jupyter notebook checking_cleaning_data.ipynb and is as follows:

with three features: 
* the ratio abstention/subscribers  
* the ratio whiteballot/subscribers 
* the ratio invalid/voters
